# Number Guessing Algorithm Analysis

## Overview
This project contains a C++ program and a Python script designed to analyze the performance of a number guessing algorithm. The C++ program calculates the average number of tries it takes to guess a number using a specific strategy, and outputs the results to a file. The Python script then reads these results and generates a graphical representation of the data.

## Files
- `main.cpp`: The C++ program that implements the number guessing algorithm and calculates the averages.
- `graph.py`: The Python script that reads the averages from the output file and generates a plot.
- `averages.txt`: The output file generated by the C++ program containing the averages.

## Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang)
- Python 3
- Matplotlib library for Python (Install using `pip install matplotlib`)

## Setup and Running

### Compiling and Running the C++ Program
1. Compile the C++ program using a C++ compiler:

```
g++ main.cpp -o main
```

2. Run the compiled program:

```
./main
```
This will generate the `averages.txt` file with the average number of tries for different divisors.

### Running the Python Script
1. Ensure you have Python and Matplotlib installed.
2. Run the script:

```
python graph.py
```

This will read the `averages.txt` file and display a plot showing the relationship between the divisor and the average number of tries.
